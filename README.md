Gym Tracker is a fitness tracking application to track your workouts, fitness goals, and progress!

### Reason behind the project

I created this project to help escape fumbling with Excel spreadsheets and editing Apple notes while at the gym. I wanted something that was simple to use while at the gym, but also had the functionality that I could use when I wasn't actively working out.

### Domains

All deployments using vercel are given multiple deployment URLs that are automatically generated. The preview deployment is the latest commit on any active branch on `jessedelira/gym-tracker`. The production deployment is the latest commit on the `main` branch. So when you click into the preview or production deployments on GitHub you will see autogenerated URLs, note when in production folder of deployments the generated URLs are the same as https://gym-tracker.app

## Deployment

Feel free to deploy however you would like if you don't want to use gym-tracker.app, what is reccomended though for deployment is Vercel. Their services are fantastic to use and free under a hobby account.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

This is a list things you need to use the Gym Tracker.

-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
-   [Docker](https://docker.com)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    -   Current version that is targeted is v18.17.0

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/jessedelira/gym-tracker.git
    ```
2. Create MySQL container
    ```sh
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```

4. Create .env at root of project and add the following:

    - Use this command: `$ openssl rand -base64 32` to create a NEXTAUTH_SECRET env var

    ```sh
      DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/gym_tracker"
      NEXTAUTH_SECRET="place_here"
      NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
      NODE_ENV="development"
    ```

5. Run `$ npm install` at root of project to install the dependencies
    - This will kick off the postinstall script, which will run `$ npx prisma migrate dev` to create the database tables and populate the database with seed data
6. Finally, run `$ npm run dev` to start the server

### Warnings

-   `warn Fast Refresh had to perform a full reload. Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/fast-refresh-reload`
    -   This is a known issue with Next.js and Fast Refresh. It's not a problem with the app, but rather a problem with Next.js. See [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/40184#issuecomment-1328881068) for more info.
