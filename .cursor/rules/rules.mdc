# Project Technology Stack & Architecture

- You can reference files using the @ symbol (e.g., @filename.ts)

## Core Technologies
1. Frontend
    - Next.js with Pages Router
    - React for UI components
    - TypeScript for type safety

2. Backend API
    - tRPC for type-safe API communication
    - Example implementation: [sessionRouter.ts](mdc:src/server/api/routers/sessionRouter.ts)
    - All endpoints are serverless (Vercel Functions)

3. Database
        - MySQL as the primary database
        - Prisma ORM for database operations
        - Database schema: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma)
        - Schema is shared between frontend/backend (monorepo structure)

4. Deployment & Infrastructure
    - Hosted on Vercel
    - Serverless architecture
        - All endpoints are stateless
        - No persistent server-side state

5. Authentication
    - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) based auth
    - Implementation details: [auth.ts](mdc:src/server/auth.ts)

6. Style and Design
    - I want to have it be a uniform feel and look
    - I like the style to be "Modern Minimalist" or "iOS-inspired" 
    - Clean, flat interfaces
    - Subtle use of shadows and borders
    - Consistent spacing and alignment
    - Monochromatic icons
    - Clear visual hierarchy
    - Card-based grouping
    - Subtle dividers and separators
    - Meaningful whitespace
    - Clear interactive elements (hover states)
    - Purposeful use of color (like the red for destructive actions)
